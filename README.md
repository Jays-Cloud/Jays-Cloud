Hi! I‚Äôm Jeremy, a Systems Technician transitioning into Cloud Security.  
My short-term goal is to grow into a **Cloud Security Engineer** role, gaining deep hands-on experience in securing cloud environments.  
Long-term, I‚Äôm working toward becoming a **Cloud Security Architect**, designing secure, scalable, and policy-driven cloud infrastructures.

My projects and labs span Splunk analysis, blue team operations, threat hunting, Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, and endpoint security. I work extensively with **Azure**, **IAM**, and **cloud security controls**, building defensible-by-default environments through **Infrastructure as Code**, **policy**, and **automation**.

## What I‚Äôm focusing on
- Cloud security architecture (Azure-focused, Zero Trust, governance, compliance)  
- Threat hunting with Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, and KQL  
- Endpoint & email security hardening (Defender for Endpoint, M365D, vulnerability management)  
- Blue team operations & incident response playbooks (Logic Apps, SOAR automation)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Identity & Access Management (IAM) governance and automation (Entra ID, CA, PIM, access reviews)  
- Cross-cloud security principles (Azure primary, AWS/GCP awareness)  


## Skills
**Cloud Security:** Azure (Networking, IAM, Conditional Access, PIM, Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel), Zero Trust architecture, governance & compliance alignment (CIS, NIST, ISO 27001)  
**Security Operations:** Threat hunting in Splunk & Sentinel (KQL), blue team operations, incident response, endpoint & email security (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, M365 Defender), SOAR automation (Logic Apps, Sentinel automation rules)  
**Identity & Access Management:** Entra ID governance, lifecycle management, access reviews, Conditional Access baselines, PIM role governance  
**Platforms:** Windows Server/AD, Intune, Exchange Online, SharePoint, AWS/GCP security principles awareness

## Certifications

**Current:**  
- Google IT Support Professional  
- CompTIA Security+  
- CompTIA Network+  
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500)

**In Progress / Planned:**  (3 Year Plan)

**2025 Roadmap**
- Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) (Expected November)

**2026 Roadmap**
- AWS Certified Security ‚Äì Specialty (Expected January 2026)
- Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) (Expected March 2026)

**2027 Roadmap**
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Professional (Expected 2027)
- Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert (SC-100) (Expected 2027)
- Terraform Associate (HashiCorp) (Expected 2027)

### üß† Career-Anchor (Keep Forever)
