Hi! I‚Äôm Jeremy ‚Äî a Systems Technician on the path to becoming a Cloud Security Engineer. My projects and labs span Splunk analysis, blue team operations, threat hunting, Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, and Endpoint Security. I work extensively with Azure, IAM, and cloud security controls, building defensible-by-default environments using IaC, policy, and automation.

## What I‚Äôm focusing on
- Cloud security architecture (Azure-focused, Zero Trust, governance, compliance)  
- Threat hunting with Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, and KQL  
- Endpoint & email security hardening (Defender for Endpoint, M365D, vulnerability management)  
- Blue team operations & incident response playbooks (Logic Apps, SOAR automation)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Identity & Access Management (IAM) governance and automation (Entra ID, CA, PIM, access reviews)  
- Cross-cloud security principles (Azure primary, AWS/GCP awareness)  


## Skills
**Cloud Security:** Azure (Networking, IAM, Conditional Access, PIM, Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel), Zero Trust architecture, governance & compliance alignment (CIS, NIST, ISO 27001)  
**Security Operations:** Threat hunting in Splunk & Sentinel (KQL), blue team operations, incident response, endpoint & email security (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, M365 Defender), SOAR automation (Logic Apps, Sentinel automation rules)  
**Identity & Access Management:** Entra ID governance, lifecycle management, access reviews, Conditional Access baselines, PIM role governance  
**Platforms:** Windows Server/AD, Intune, Exchange Online, SharePoint, AWS/GCP security principles awareness

## Certifications

**Current:**  
- Google IT Support Professional  
- CompTIA Security+  
- CompTIA Network+  
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)  

**In Progress / Planned:**  
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500)  
- Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert (SC-100)  
- CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)  
- CompTIA Project+  
- Linux Essentials
- CrowdStrike Certified Identity Specialist (CCIS)
- CISSP

 ## Education
- Planned: B.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance ‚Äî Western Governors University (WGU)

## Featured Projects
- **Incident Handling with Splunk** ‚Äî Analyzed simulated attack scenarios, leveraged OSINT, tracked activity via Cyber Kill Chain, and built Splunk queries to detect IOCs.  
- **Microsoft Sentinel Implementation** ‚Äî Deployed and configured Sentinel with data connectors, KQL queries, and automated alerts for Azure security events.
-  **Secure Azure Storage Account (Terraform)** ‚Äî Provisioned StorageV2 with ZRS, enforced HTTPS, encryption, versioning, and retention policies using Terraform. 
- **Identity Zero Trust** ‚Äî Conditional Access, PIM, access reviews & lifecycle automation.  
- **Azure Firewall Implementation** ‚Äî Deployed VNet, configured Network/Application/NAT rules, and enforced UDRs to secure inbound/outbound traffic.
- **Windows Server & AD File Sharing** ‚Äî Configured Domain Controller, NTFS/share permissions, and AD security groups on an Azure VM for secure, role-based access.
